	Bank switcher's wait state generator (U10A) drops the CPU into an infinite wait state if JP2 is shorted.
		Trigger for the wait state is only active when !WR is asserted, and the wait state keeps the CPU on the trigger address. So it clears and re-triggers every cycle.
		Doesn't seem to be necessary, at least when the switch is made from the safe page. Would be nice if it worked though.
	Persistent memory comparator in bank switcher should be widened to $3FFF. Preferably by jumper.
